# NoDash

Simple utilities function that you can use in your projects.

You can simple copy the code and paste it in your project or you can install it with `npm`. But I suggest you to copy the code and paste it in your project because it's a small library and you can modify it as you want.

The code is written in TypeScript and you can use it in your TypeScript projects.
